    Correct implementation for multi-category likelihood ratio updates.
    
    For multiple competing hypotheses with likelihood ratios, we need to:
    1. Understand that LRs are typically given relative to a reference category
    2. Convert LRs to actual likelihoods 
    3. Apply Bayes' theorem properly
    
    The key insight: In medical diagnosis, LRs are often given as:
    LR = P(evidence|disease) / P(evidence|no disease)
    
    But for multiple categories, we need to be careful about what "no disease" means.
